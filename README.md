# Virtual Data Science Internship with Bharat Intern

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing the culmination of my virtual data science internship with Bharat Intern! This repository contains two exciting projects:

### Project 1: Stock Price Prediction of Amazon

In this project, I've built a powerful stock price prediction model for Amazon using LSTM-based time series forecasting techniques. The model provides accurate predictions for Amazon's future closing prices, empowering stakeholders with valuable insights to make informed investment decisions. The code includes detailed data analysis, visualization, and advanced machine-learning algorithms.

### Project 2: Titanic Classification Model

For this project, I've designed a robust classification model to predict the survival status of passengers on the Titanic using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest classifiers. By meticulously analyzing the dataset and evaluating model performance, I've gained valuable insights into the effectiveness of different algorithms for this specific classification task.

You can explore the code, data, and results of both projects. They are valuable resources for anyone interested in stock price prediction and classification tasks. These projects provide a hands-on experience with real-world datasets and machine learning techniques.

I hope you find these projects insightful and inspiring. Don't hesitate to provide feedback or suggestions for further improvements. Happy exploring and learning!
