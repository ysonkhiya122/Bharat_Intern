## Task 2: Titanic Classification Model

This task involved designing a powerful classification model to predict the survival status of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic. Leveraging popular classification algorithms - Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest - I meticulously analyzed the Titanic dataset, performed data preprocessing, and trained multiple models. By evaluating their performance, I gained valuable insights into the effectiveness of each algorithm for this specific classification task.

**Key Features:**
- Performed data preprocessing to handle missing values and categorical features.
- Trained and evaluated Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest classifiers.
- Calculated accuracy, generated confusion matrix, and printed classification report for each model.
