# Virtual Data Science Internship with Bharat Intern

## Task 1: Stock Price Prediction of Amazon

In this exciting project, I completed the challenging task of developing a robust stock price prediction model for one of the world's leading e-commerce giants, **Amazon**. Leveraging my data science skills, I performed extensive data analysis and feature engineering to extract valuable insights from historical stock market data. By implementing cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, including time series forecasting techniques, I accurately forecasted Amazon's stock prices, enabling stakeholders to make informed investment decisions.

**Key Highlights:**
- Conducted comprehensive data exploration and preprocessing to ensure high-quality data inputs.
- Utilized LSTM-based time series forecasting to predict future stock prices.
- Visualized historical closing prices, rolling mean, and standard deviation for deeper insights.
- Employed volume analysis and moving averages to understand trading activity patterns.
- Provided valuable predictions to assist stakeholders in making informed investment decisions.
